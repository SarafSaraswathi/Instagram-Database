# Instagram-Database
This schema models a photo-sharing app with users, photos, comments, likes, and follows. Users can post photos, comment on them, like them, and follow other users. Tags can be added to photos for categorization via a many-to-many relationship. Timestamps track creation times across all entities for activity logging.
